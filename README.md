# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Todo:

All frontend

Backend:

1. User Authentication (JWT or Sessions):
If you're not already handling authentication securely, this is crucial. Implementing user authentication ensures that only logged in users have access to their own profiles and are able to see all their previous reviews 

Using JWT (JSON Web Tokens):

When a user logs in, generate a JWT token and send it back to the frontend.
Store the JWT token in the frontend (e.g., localStorage or sessionStorage).
When making requests, the token is sent in the Authorization header to authenticate the user.
On the backend, verify the JWT token on protected routes.

Backend: Generate and verify JWT token (using jsonwebtoken package)

2. Save User ID After Login (Frontend):
Local Storage / Session Storage: After a user successfully logs in, you should save their user_id in the browser's localStorage or sessionStorage. This way, the ID is available across page reloads.
Set Up the Navbar with User Info: Once the user ID is stored, you can fetch the userâ€™s details (like username) and display them in the navbar.

3. Logout Functionality (Frontend):
Clear Stored User ID: When the user logs out, ensure that you clear the user_id from localStorage or sessionStorage.
Update Navbar to Show Login/Signup: Change the navbar to show the login/signup buttons instead of user details when logged out.
